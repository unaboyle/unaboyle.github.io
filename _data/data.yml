    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Hi! I'm Una, a Research Data Scientist at 
      <a href="https://www.proto.ai">Proto AI</a>, where I spend my time
      researching new algorithms, mathematical tools, and applications for 
      our proprietary AI.
      Before joining Proto AI, I was a Data Scientist for 3 years at 
      <a href="https://www.photobutler.com">Photo Butler</a>, where I 
      created production-ready computer vision AI and software for the 
      photography industry. 
      I have also completed several internships centered around data 
      analysis & modeling in various domains of research including nuclear 
      fusion energy, bioinformatics, and geophysics. 
      I graduated with a BS in Applied Mathematics from Yale, and am 
      currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Harvard. 
      My background within the field of data science lies primarily in 
      machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. 
      I'm generally interested in any AI/ML-centered roles (especially for 
      research), but open to other options too.
      You can find links to my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and personal projects 
      on GitHub in the sidebar if you would like to learn more!
