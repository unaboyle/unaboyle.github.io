#     title: About
#     summary: |
#       I'm a data scientist with 3 years of experience working at a 
#       startup called Photo Butler. Before that, I completed several internships 
#       centered around data analysis & modeling in several industries including 
#       nuclear fusion energy, bioinformatics for cancer research, and geophysics 
#       (climate change). I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Yale, 
#       and am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Harvard Extension School. 
#       My background within the field of data science lies primarily in machine 
#       learning, deep learning, and computer vision and I'm interested in working 
#       on any application of artificial intelligence or machine learning.
