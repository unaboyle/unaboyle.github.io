    summary: |
      I'm a data scientist with 3 years of experience working at a 
      startup called Photo Butler. Before that, I completed several internships 
      centered around data analysis & modeling in several industries including 
      nuclear fusion energy, bioinformatics for cancer research, and geophysics 
      (climate change). I graduated with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Yale, 
      and am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Harvard Extension School. 
      My background within the field of data science lies primarily in machine 
      learning, deep learning, and computer vision and I'm interested in working 
      on any application of artificial intelligence or machine learning.
