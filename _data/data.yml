    title: About
    summary: |
      Hi! I'm Una, a data scientist with 3 years of experience in the software 
      industry working at a startup called Photo Butler. Before that, I completed 
      several internships centered around data analysis & modeling in several 
      other industries including nuclear fusion energy, bioinformatics for cancer 
      research, and geophysics (climate change). I graduated with a BS in 
      Applied Mathematics from Yale, and am currently pursuing a Master's degree 
      at Harvard Extension School. My background within the field of data science 
      lies primarily in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. 
      I'm interested in working on any application of artificial intelligence or 
      machine learning, but open to other options too.
